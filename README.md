# RockPaperScissors
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors command-line-tool game programmed in Swift as an answer key for a challenge I shared with my students.

This code does not have the intention to be elegant; quite the opposite. Different parts of the code that work alike were intentionally developed in different manners, so students could see some possibilities of paths for them to follow.
